> I wanted to talk to the computer using my own language

goof or goForth: a stack-based concatenative programming language inspired by [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)) and implemented in Go.

I made this contraption to learn more about compilers and computer architecture.
I did not use [LLVM](https://llvm.org/), and kept the target machine `x86_64` for this language since I wanted to get insights into the compilation process (and hopefully learn some non-trivial aspects about binaries).

## Idea

I always wanted a self hosted compiler for my own language. The big picture is to build a simple computer catered for the langauge.
The idea for this project stemmed from [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/). But I believe the book spoon feeds the concepts and at the end you have an emulator program for running your language and not a native program that you can call independent. Hence bootstrapping through this route would have been very difficult.
Majority of the project has been inspired from [tsoding](https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily) and his [porth](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VbMZA7wW9aR3EtBqe2kinu4) series which is a language like Forth but in python. I decided to write this in go for various reasons I find meaningful.

## Usage

You would require the following for compiling the language to a 64 bit ELF executable file.
- [go](https://go.dev/)
- [nasm](https://nasm.us/): Netwide Assembler is being used to generate the object file for `x86_64` architecture after translating the language to assembly.
- [ld](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ld): For linking the generated object file to final ELF executable.

The following flowchart summarizes the workflow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[test.goof]-- main.go -->B[output.asm]-- nasm -->C[output.o]-- ld -->D[output]
```

For compiling the program written in `test.goof` and writing to an ELF executable `output` (you can check the generated assembly in `output.asm`)
```shell
go run main.go com ./test.goof
./output
```

The compiled binary can be verified using `file` and `ldd` commands.
```shell
$ file output
output: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped

$ ldd output
	not a dynamic executable
```

## Language Reference

The language implements the following *goofy* constructs

### Literals

#### Integer

Currently a sequence of digits which may optionally start with a dash (-) is interpreted as an integer.

```pascal
10 1 +
```

The code above pushes 10 and 1 to the stack, `+` operator pops them, sums them up and then pushes the result (11) on top of stack.

#### String

A string is a sequence of characters sandwiched between double quotes (").

```pascal
include "std.goof"

"Hello World\n" stdout write
```

When the compiler encounters a string the following happens:
1. the size of the string in bytes is pushed onto the stack,
2. the bytes of the string are copied somewhere into the memory,
3. the pointer to the beginning of the string is pushed onto the data stack.

### Intrinsics

#### stack

| `and` | `[a: int] [b: int] -- [a & b: int]`  | bitwise `and`                    |

#### Memory

- `mem` - pushes the memory address on the stack
```pascal
push(mem)
```

- `,` - **load**: pops the memory address from stack and pushes the value present at that address (dereferences the memory address present on top of stack)
```pascal
mem = pop()
value = get_value_at_address(mem)
push(value)
```

- `.` - **store**: pops the value from stack, pops memory address from stack and stores the value at that address
```pascal
value = pop()
mem = pop()
set_value_at_address(mem, value)
```

#### System

- `syscall<n>` - perform a syscall with n arguments where n is in range `[0..6]`. (`syscall1`, `syscall2`, etc)

```porth
syscall_number = pop()
<move syscall_number to the corresponding register>
for i in range(n):
    arg = pop()
    <move arg to i-th register according to the call convention>
<perform the syscall>
```

- `include` - includes the tokens from a goof file into the current file.
